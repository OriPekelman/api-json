        <h2>APIs.json Format Definitions</h2>
        <p>The format is designed for public deployment and for consumption by automated software agents (robots). This document is written in loose RFC style for the purposes of clarity, but it is not an official recommendation. Discussion around the format takes place on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson" target="_blank">APIs.json mailing list</a>.
        
        <p>Current Versions of the format:
        
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/kinlane/10094618.js"></script>
        
        <p>The format is also available on Github:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>https://github.com/api-commons</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We will periodically take versions of the spec and post them here as new versions.</>
